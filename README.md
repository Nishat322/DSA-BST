# DSA-BST

## 1. Draw A BST 
- Given the data `3,1,4,6,9,2,5,7` if you were to insert this into an empty binary search tree, what would the tree look like? (Draw the tree, no coding needed here.)
- Draw the BST with the keys - `E A S Y Q U E S T I O N`

## 2. Remove the root
- Show how the above trees would look like if you deleted the root of each tree. (Draw the trees, no coding needed here.)

## 3. Create a BST class
- Walk through the binary search tree code in the curriculum and understand it well. Then write a BinarySearchTree class with its core functions (`insert()`, `remove()`, `find()`) from scratch.
    - Create a binary search tree called BST and insert `3,1,4,6,9,2,5,7` into your tree. Compare your result with the result from the 1st exercise.
    - Create a binary search tree called BST and insert `E A S Y Q U E S T I O N` into your tree. Compare your result with the result from the 1st exercise.
